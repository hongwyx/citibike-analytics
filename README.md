1. Ways to clean:
    1. Record issues
        1. wrong station coords
        2. Nan station locations
        3. Handling special station cases
        4. End station (not in NY) cases
        5. Overly long trips - threshold?
    2. specific issues
        1. Person’s birth year
        2. Gender 
        3. Speed too fast
        4. Same start and end station
        5. New stations added during the year
    3. Versions 
2. Questions
    1. Do prices affect customer behavior?
        1. Assign value to each ride, bucket by value, look at customer type, speed, dates, times, start end locations
        2. are there trends/dips?
    2. Conditional on customer type, what are some behavior differences?
    3. Conditional on speed, hat are some behavior differences?
        1. Bucket into fast/casual riders
    4. Weather - how does weather affect rider behavior, esp. from a speed perspective?
    5. Traffic - what are time/speed implications based on time of day and start/end points?
    6. Alternative for subway - what are different “demand” trends for bike stations close to a subway station versus not?
    7. Any special days during the year? Weekday/weekend? Times during the day?
