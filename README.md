This is a project aiming to quantify weather risk for the Citi Bike business. We aim to answer the following questions:

QUANTIFYING RISK
What is the effect of a weather event on pass sales?
How does the same weather event affect sales for different products, and for different consumer groups?
SIMULATING RISK
What is the best/average/worse case affect of weather risk in a given time period?
How can climate change potentially affect the business?
MITIGATING RISK
How much is the business exposed to weather risk?
What are some strategies the business should consider leveraging to minimize weather risk?
